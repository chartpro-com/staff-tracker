## Description

During this week, I was tasked with creating a command-line application that can manage a company's employee database. To accomplish this, I utilized Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. Since the application is not intended to be deployed, I have created a step-by-step video that showcases its features and ensures that all acceptance criteria have been satisfied.
